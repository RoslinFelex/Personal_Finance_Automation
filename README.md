# Personal_Finance_Automation
Python + SLM Automation Code with sample input and output files for reference.
The code performs personal finance spending analysis.
The SLM code is commented out; note that the model is not fine-tuned. For better accuracy, further training is required.
The automation is built to run on Google Colab—please refer to the article for step-by-step instructions.
Create a folder in Google Drive named “Financial_Analysis” and upload the input file there.
Ensure the input file includes these headers: Date, Narration, Withdrawal Amt, Deposit Amt, Closing Balance.
The Date column must be in dd/mm/yyyy format.
If categories are extracted from the Narration column, update the “Category Handling” section under Block 4A – Monthly & Category Analysis.
After running the code, you’ll be prompted with a message box in the output area where you need to enter the input file name.
Once execution is complete, the output will be saved in the same Google Drive folder.
